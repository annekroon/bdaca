# Research Master Course 'Big Data and Automated Content Analysis, Part I + II'

These are materials for the new 12 EC (16 weeks) course taught at the University of Amsterdam.

The [old slides](../rm-course-2) and the [old book](../book) from previous years are still online for your reference, but in this folder, you find the teaching materials that we will use from 2021 onwards.

The main difference is that we now use a new book:
> Van Atteveldt, W., Trilling, D., Arcila Calder√≥n, C. (2021): Computational analysis of communication: A practical introduction to the analysis of texts, networks, and images with code examples in Python and R. *Hoboken, NJ: Wiley*

Students liked the old book a lot, and it was continously improved over the years, but it also started to get outdated a bit. The field is evolving quickly, and what was a good practice in 2016 not necessarily is a good practice any more. Also, the book was originally written for a shorter 6-EC course, and misses materials for especially the last weeks of this course. Finally, it lacked some depth and background in some sections (it omitted, for instance, large parts of the mathematical background of several machine learning techniques).

Vice versa, the new book was in fact very much inspired by the setup of this course, so you will find that -- while we will not cover each of its 500 pages -- the table of contents neatly maps to the weeks of this course.

For the exact schedule, please see the [course manual](syllabus/bd-aca_12ECTS_werkboek.pdf).

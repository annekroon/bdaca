      "that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\n",

      "As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\n",
      "continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\n",
      "continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\n",
      "Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\n",
      "ceremonial aspects of it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\n",

      "Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\n",
      "couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n",
      "7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\n",
      "God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\n",
      "Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\n",
      "This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\n",

      "present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\n",

      "plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\n",
      "use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\n",
      "the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\n",
      "view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\n",
      "Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\n",
      "Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\n",

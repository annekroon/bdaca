``Big data'' is a relatively new phenomenon, and refers to data that are more voluminous, but often also more unstructured and dynamic, than traditionally the case. In Communication Science and the Social Sciences more broadly, this in particular concerns research that draws on Internet-based data sources such as social media, large digital archives, and public comments to news and products This emerging field of studies is also called \emph{Computational Social Science} \citep{Lazer2009} or even \emph{Comutational Communication Science} \citep{Shah2015}.

%One of the big challenges is being able to derive information from these data that can be handled meaningfully and economically at the same time.

The course will provide insights in the concepts, challenges and opportunities associated with data so large that traditional research methods (like manual coding) cannot be applied any more and traditional inferential statistics start to loose their meaning. Participants are introduced to strategies and techniques for capturing and analyzing digital data in communication contexts. We will focus on (a) data harvesting, storage, and preprocessing and (b) computer-aided content analysis, including natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science approaches. In particular, we will use advanced machine learning approaches and models like word embeddings.

To participate in this course, students are expected to be interested in learning how to write own programs where off-the-shelf software is not available. Some basic understanding of programming languages is helpful, but not necessary to enter the course. Students without such knowledge are encouraged to follow the (free) online course at \url{https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python} to prepare.

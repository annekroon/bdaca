    "- The example code at https://github.com/damian0604/bdaca/blob/master/ipynb/timeseries.ipynb\n",

    "As you will see when starting to analyze the data, you might actually *not* arrive at the same conclusion, *depending on your model specification*. We can discuss why this is the case and what the implications of this are in class, but first and foremost, do not focus too much on discripancies with the author's original analysis. The authors provide the R Markdown code that allows you to replicate exactly what they did in R, if you want.\n",
